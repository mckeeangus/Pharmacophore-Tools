# Pharmacophore — adrb2/orthosteric__negative

- Ligands loaded: **7** (direct=1, template=6)
- Skipped poses: 0
- Consensus method: `kmeans`
- Representative ligand (viz): `6PS3_CVD_A1201`
- Features kept: **4**

Support is the fraction of the cell's ligands that contribute to a feature (one row per feature / peak; all features are kept only above the support floor).

| Feature | Points | Ligands | Support |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Acceptor 1 | 7 | 7 | 1.00 |
| Aromatic 1 | 14 | 7 | 1.00 |
| Donor 1 | 7 | 7 | 1.00 |
| PosIonizable 1 | 4 | 4 | 0.57 |

## Feature resolution

Co-incident dual classifications collapsed by the feature hierarchy (higher-priority family kept on the shared atom); the listed ligands each carried both types on one atom.

| Kept ← dropped | Events | Ligands |
|---|---:|---|
| Aromatic ← LumpedHydrophobe | 12 | 2RH1_CAU_A408, 3NY9_JSZ_A1203, 6PS3_CVD_A1201, 6PS4_JRZ_A1201, 6PS5_SNP_A1201, 9RKF_A1JHU_A520 |
| PosIonizable ← Donor | 7 | 2RH1_CAU_A408, 3NY9_JSZ_A1203, 6PS3_CVD_A1201, 6PS4_JRZ_A1201, 6PS5_SNP_A1201, 6PS6_TIM_A1201, 9RKF_A1JHU_A520 |
