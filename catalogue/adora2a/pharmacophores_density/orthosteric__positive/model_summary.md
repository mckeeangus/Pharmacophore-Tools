Support is the fraction of the cell's ligands that contribute to a feature (one row per feature / peak; all features are kept only above the support floor).

| Feature | Points | Ligands | Support |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Acceptor 1 | 20 | 5 | 0.83 |
| Acceptor 2 | 18 | 6 | 1.00 |
| PosIonizable 1 | 5 | 5 | 0.83 |

See `pharmacophore.json` (model), `features.csv` (raw points + cluster ids), and `raw_features_*.png` (per-family point distributions, each kept peak annotated with its label and support).
